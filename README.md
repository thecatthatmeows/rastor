# Glyph
Glyph is a 2d game engine that works in the terminal. For now, it is in very very early development only supporting:
- shapes:
    - rectangles
    - triangles
    - lines
- 2d rotation

Although the terminal wasnt really made for games, this serves more as a fun project to work on.
I made this project cuz I was bored

## How to run
1. download rust
2. yes

## Future Plans
We plan on Glyph being both a 2d and 3d game engine (which works in the terminal).
Too bad, we dont plan on Glyph being used for embedding animations inside another TUI software. Though, you can make your own fork of this repo to support embedding.

Features:
- More shapes
- Z-index (depth sorting)
- Some sort of a camera system
